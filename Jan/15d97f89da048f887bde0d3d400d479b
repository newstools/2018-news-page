So the whole day I have been out at Hoerskool Overvaal in the Vaal reporting for Power FM. The school uses Afrikaans as a medium of instruction. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi took the school to court on this matter. This Afrikaans speaking lady says she does NOT understand why her language is still being used at schools.
