The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members have staged protests outside various H&M stores around Gauteng against a monkey sweater advert. The retailer had used a black child to model a sweatshirt with the slogan “coolest monkey in the jungle”. H&M later removed the advert and apaologised for any offense caused. Videos circulating around on social media show EFF members singing and dancing outside stores in Sandton, Menlyn and Mall of the South
