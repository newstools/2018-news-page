AS RECEIVED Friday, 12 January, 2018 (21h30) KIDNAP_ Cornelia Grobler (62) kidnapped while walking with Gert Peo (55) to the Engen garage in Ermelo. Suspects in a VW Golf stopped and told Gert that he should run or they would shoot him. Cornelia was forced into the vehicle at gunpoint and was found later by the neighborhood watch and Police 2 Km away. Suspects had beaten Cornelia and chopped off 8 of her toes. Gert reported that the suspects were Nigerian nationals/foreigners, and that they did not attempt to rob either himself, or Cornelia (MP, Gert Sibande District, Msukaligwa Municipality, Ermelo) [Netwerk24, Elise Tempelhoff, 14 Jan 18, 19:37] Comment: We initially thought this may be an ‘express kidnapping” whereby a victim is taken off the street and forced to access funds or valuables before they are dumped again. Details may still emerge to clarify the motive. Comment ends.
