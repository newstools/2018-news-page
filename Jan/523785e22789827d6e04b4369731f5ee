On Sunday, a video went viral on Twitter after a user posted footage of a South African teacher from Randburg referring to pupils in his class as “idiotic blacks”. As reported by TimesLive, things only got worse from there… The teacher from Hoerskool Die Burger goes on a minute-and-a-half long rant about “idiots” and how it relates to black pupils in his class. “24 years into Democracy and this is the kind of racist behavior that my sister and her peers have to endure from their educator every morning at Hoerskool Die Burger .” – The text above the video posted on Twitter. EFF leaders Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu were also tagged in the video. TimesLIVE is also now reporting that the teacher is from Hoerskool Die Burger in Randburg, Gauteng. The man can be seen shouting at pupils regarding their behaviour, before the rant quickly turned racist. The video has since been viewed 15, 000 times in 4 hours. You can watch the video with subtitles for yourself below. The Gauteng department of education look set to release a statement soon, and are expected to take action.  It’s the last thing the Gauteng Education Department needed to see, following a chaotic week over at Hoerskool Overvaal in Vereeniging. The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria stated that the province’s Department of Education acted unlawfully in instructing the Afrikaans-medium school to admit 55 English-speaking learners. The school were met by fierce protests from both the EFF and ANC as students went back to school after the summer holidays. However, it seems Hoerskool Overvaal aren’t the only education centre to be attracting negative headlines in the province.
