Last night 6 year old Mikayla-Sue Grove was bitten in the face by a Mozambique spitting cobra. Her mother Inge went to go investigate and was sprayed in the eyes from a distance of about 30 cm. In between trying to wash her eyes out and get to the hospital with the daughter her dad Ludwig had arranged water for his wife. At the Ballito hospital the doctor did exactly what is expected. He started a drip with 10 vials of SAVP polyvalent antivenom and then when the swelling reached her throat he intubated her so that she would not suffocate. Dr Christoff Bell who is a snake bite experts helped with the treatment protocol etc. If I got bitten I would want him advising as well. Dr Ian Lander was the doctor who treated her and was/is a star. Little Mikayla is still sedated but wakes up and complains about the tube in her throat and obviously the pain of the swelling. Her mother has recovered from the venom in the eyes and is with her daughter. The necrotic (dead) tissue on her chin does not look as bad as what I was expecting but the next week is critical. Deep tissue necrosis is not unusual with these snake bites. The parents gave permission for me to use her pictures and their names. I will keep you posted as I get new photos.
