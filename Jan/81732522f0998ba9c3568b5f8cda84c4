Police are searching for two suspects they say fired at officers during a “robbery in progress” at a 7-11 store early Tuesday morning in downtown Baltimore. Police say Citiwatch camera monitors called out a robbery in progress at around 1:10 a.m. at the store located at 300 N. Charles Street. When officers arrived on scene, the two suspects shot at the officers, and the officers then returned fire. The suspects then fled in opposite directions. Police say it is not certain whether or not the suspects were struck. Police say officers are checking hospitals for anyone who may have recently arrived with gunshot wounds. No officers were injured in the incident.
