AS RECEIVED Please be aware of 2 guys who are scamming people at ATM’s at BP on William Nicol (on the way from monte casino to the Pretoria offramp). This victim got scammed out of R5200 today. The same guys were there yesterday as seen from CCTV footage. These guys make the ATM malfunction and then offer your assistance and that’s when they get your pin and remove your card. Don’t become of this!!
