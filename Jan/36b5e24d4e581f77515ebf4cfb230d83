Two people sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate after an apparent farm attack in Rietgat in the Hennenman District this afternoon. When ER24 arrived on the scene at 14h20, they found one patient in the kitchen. Upon further assessment, he was found to have sustained minor injuries. Paramedics treated the man but he later refused transportation to a hospital. His wife was already transported to a nearby doctor prior to ER24â€™s arrival. She had sustained moderate injuries. It is believed that they were stabbed with an unknown object in their home. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident were not yet known to our paramedics but police were on the scene for further investigations.
