AS RECEIVED This woman was our domestic. On Monday, 15 January 2018, I let her in to clean the house like usual. When I came home, she had left the house as is and stolen nearly R80 000 worth of our stuff. INCLUDING things of great sentimental value. I find it terrible to think someone can steal so much and just get away free with no repercussions. This is the case number and details from SAPS. CONST.K MANARI (0767512698) investigating the case. HONEYDEW ref nr CAS 501/1/2018.Unit contact detail:011-7941236. If anyone has any details on the where abouts of this woman please contact me, Casper or the investigating officer at SAPS.
DO NOT LET THIS PERSON IN YOUR HOME. SHE IS A THIEF!
