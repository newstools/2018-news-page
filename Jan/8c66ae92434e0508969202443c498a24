“They must take ‘no’ for an answer because they tried and they didn’t win‚ so they can take their kids somewhere else. Every child has a right to learn in their home language and we don’t have a colour issue here‚ but they want to make it a colour issue. We’ve got black kids here who are prepared to learn in Afrikaans‚ so why don’t their kids do the same?” Van Heerden asked. He said if parents want their children to learn in English‚ they should take them to English-speaking schools instead of causing “havoc” for the Afrikaans school’s executives. #HoërskoolOvervaal: EFF member Azwi Tshitangano says: “That white fellow came and insulted us, he cannot call black people mase p****. If they want violence, we will meet them with violence. If they want peace, we will meet them with peace.” @News24 @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/jxHvnt3OpD — Iavan Pijoos (@iavanpijoos) January 17, 2018  Some sing and dance, some crawl, but the picket continues at #HoërskoolOvervaal. @News24 @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/YHkJycuvLo — Iavan Pijoos (@iavanpijoos) January 17, 2018   Those who oppressed our grandparents might have succeeded, those who oppressed our parents might have succeed, but one thing is for sure, our children will not be oppressed – #Lesufi @TeamNews24 #BackToSchool — Nation Nyoka* (@Naewizzle) January 17, 2018  “Skiet hulle, skiet hulle, (shoot them, shoot them),” #EFF supporters chant at police outside #HoërskoolOvervaal. @News24 pic.twitter.com/PRvJR0KFh8 — Iavan Pijoos (@iavanpijoos) January 17, 2018
