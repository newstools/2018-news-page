Attempts by the family of a Bronkhorstspruit man – accused of sexually assaulting his parents’ domestic worker and then forcing her to perform sexual acts on his dogs – to avoid prosecution would not fly. Prosecutor Solly Ledallo spoke in court where the National Prosecuting Authority was opposing the application to send him to Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital for observation. He said the family was only trying to influence the man’s criminal case. “We are opposing this application because one of the strategies used by suspects to avoid being prosecuted is faking mental instability. This application could see him sent to the Pretoria hospital for 30 days for observation. We are well aware that suspects often go to Weskoppies and then act as if as if they are not mentally stable to avoid facing the consequences for their actions,” Ledallo argued. The 45-year-old accused was arrested in November and his first appearance attracted protest action from angry EFF and ANC members. This was after he allegedly first held the woman against her will in a room on October 23 before forcing her to perform a sexual act on him and then raping her. He then instructed her to have sex with the family pets, the charge sheet stated. He was charged with 10 counts which include, rape, sexual assault, kidnapping and malicious damage to property. However, these could be scrapped should he be declared mentally unstable. Investigating officer Moses Mabena told the court that he charged the accused and he did not appear mentally challenged. “In my 18 years as a police officer I can say I did not experience any problems with the accused except taking his fingerprints; his fingers are deformed. There was also no communication breakdown,” Mabena said. The accused was able to give his personal details and make a statement like a normal person.
