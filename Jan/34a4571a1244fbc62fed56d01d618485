A rather unfortunate Toyota Hilux driver had quite the nightmare on Monday morning as he witnessed first-hand just how strong the ocean can be. The man’s bakkie was pulled into the ocean by strong waves just as he was attempting to pull a small boat out of the water at Salmon Bay beach in Ballito. In a video posted on Facebook by Storm Report Live, the bakkie can be seen struggling to reverse as he tries to pull the boat out, instead the tide pulls it towards the ocean where it is overpowered by waves. According to Salmon beach’s Marine Safety manager Steve Honneysett who spoke to DRUM, the tide on the day was higher than usual “The problem we had today is that tide was extremely high and the sand was steep so when the vehicle tried to push the boat in, it got stuck and the waves ended up pulling the van into the water,” he said.
