AS RECEIVED This guy deserves some recognition! A biker.. Climbs off his bike as robots all over Fourways have been out for ages now.. So this is cnr Main Rd and Robin (robots between Sloane and Witkoppen) traffic was insane! Where is outsurance or metro? Canâ€™t slack outsurance off to much but JHB Metro? Fat chance! But in a nutshell this dude did what others are paid to do and are part of their job description! For what I assume is not his job or hobby he did a great job! Bit confused but eased traffic nonetheless! Thank you to whoever you are! Job well done!
