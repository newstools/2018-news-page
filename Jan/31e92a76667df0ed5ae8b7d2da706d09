AS RECEIVED : Last weekend a family were attacked and robbed in their home in Pretoria, South Africa. Their niece was beaten with a crowbar, her husband stabbed and shot in the head. Their two young daughters were tied up and witnessed this gruesome event. Their niece’s husband survived. The bullet came out above his eye. They are all very traumatized. Ironically his shirt says born in Africa. This is what happens in South Africa on a daily basis, innocent people attacked, raped, robbed and murdered, family members lost and families left to grieve. Physical wounds can heal, but the psychological wounds may never heal. Wishing them God’s Healing Hands and Comfort. God Bless.
