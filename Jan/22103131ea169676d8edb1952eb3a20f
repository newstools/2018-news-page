LOOKOUT!!! For a sky blue Toyota Corolla with tinted wondows as per the attached video. The suspects from this vehicle robbed a man at gunpoint today in Cumberland Rd Kensington . They took cellphones, a small amount of cash and some baby clothes which were in a bag. Nobody was physically injured and no shots were fired. Once again the criminals were presented with what they need most which is opportunity. Before arriving make sure someone is there to open the gate immediately and say your goodbyes inside the property before leaving promptly. Always be proactive and vigilant..
