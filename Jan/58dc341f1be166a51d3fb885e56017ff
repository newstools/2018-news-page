Three days after her husband died in a road accident, the textile businessmanâ€™s wife, allegedly committed suicide by jumping off the fifth floor of their apartment in City Light on Monday. Shweta Surekha, whose husband Anand, had died on Sachin-Magdalla Road near Vesu, died on the spot due to severe injuries. It is suspected that she jumped from the bathroom window. Some residents of the apartment, who were on the ground floor first noticed that a glass shattered on the ground. Soon, they saw Shweta coming out of the window and sensed something serious. Two persons even ran to catch hold of her when she was falling, but their efforts were in vain. One of them suffered a fracture in the hand.
Earlier, on January 13, Anand died reportedly after being crushed by an unidentified truck on Sachin-Magdalla highway near Vesu at around 8:30pm. The family members had informed the police that Anand had probably gone to Abhva village for some work and while returning he must stopped midway. He was crushed by a truck while crossing the road, the police said.
