Running battles between police and angered local community members have dominated protests, with Krugersdorp News reporting residents were awoken by the noise of protest, burning tyres, and shots being fired early on Monday morning. Motorists are being urged to avoid the Southern entrance of Munsieville, as the Mogale City shutdown (known as #KrugersdorpShutdown on social media) takes hold of the Johannesburg suburb. Local residents have been left exasperated at the overwhelming wave of crime sweeping across the region. They are agitated with the authorities, who they feel aren’t doing enough to fight the war on drugs. Krugersdorp inhabitants say that drug use, gang culture and even human trafficking is engulfing their city. Now, they’re on the streets venting their anger. And it seems they have picked out their targets. As well as law enforcement, there is a strong sense of anti-Nigerian sentiment in the city. Many Nigerian immigrants in the region are suspected of being in the country illegally. They are currently bearing the brunt of the protests, for alleged participation in and organisation of crime rings. The #krugersdorpShutdown is about residents of 5 townships around #Mogalecity marching against influx of undocumented foreign nationals. — Lirandzu Themba (@LirandzuThemba) January 22, 2018  “Away with Nigerians”.
