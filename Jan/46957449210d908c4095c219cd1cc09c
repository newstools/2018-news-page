Shocking dashcam footage shows the moment a violent shootout broke out at a set of traffic lights. It shows a gold Toyota sitting at the intersection in Pensacola, FL, when a silver Lexus pulls up – and begins firing shots at the car. Five shots come from one handgun, with another blasting out of a second weapon pointed out the window by the Lexus’ passenger. The driver of the gold Toyota scrambles out of his car as the bullets fly, takes cover alongside a red pickup, and returns two shots of his own as the Lexus speeds up. It disappears from sight – and then fires a final shot back at the Toyota driver, who gets back into his car and speeds off, running a red. Escambia County Sheriff’s Office said the shooting was drug-related, and that they have arrested the Toyota driver, Jonathan Olds. They are still looking for the Lexus shooter, named as Jonathan James Harris.
