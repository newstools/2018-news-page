An armed robbery suspect was shot dead and two bystanders were shot and injured during an armed robbery in Area 2 on Hazelmere Road in Verulam a short while ago. At approximately 19:42 a Peugeot drove to RUSA Offices in Verulam. Two of the occupants in the vehicle were shot. The victims explained that they had gone to a tuck shop to purchase bread when they noticed four armed suspects robbing the business. The two turned to flee when the suspects exited the store and started shooting at them. One of the victimâ€™s was shot in the arm while the second victim was shot in the buttocks. They informed Reaction Officers that one suspect was also shot by his accomplices. Paramedics treated the two for their injuries before transporting them to hospital. Reaction Officers proceeded to the location of the shooting and found that the suspect had died at the scene. It is alleged that he was seriously injured after he was accidentally shot in the neck by his accomplices who fled the scene shortly after the shooting. The community then stoned the critically injured suspect to death. A 9mm pistol with an extended magazine containing live ammunition was found near the deceased (picture 2). Several 9mm spent cartridges were also recovered at the scene. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa conducted an extensive search for the remaining suspects however no arrests were made.
