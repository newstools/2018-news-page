A man was filmed hanging from a door of a moving truck in Johannesburg on the N3 just after Grey street bridge. A passenger in a passing car shot a video and shared it on social media. It is not known how the man got to be hanging from such a dangerous position but it is suspected it could have been a hijacking gone wrong.
