Cape Town – An IT technician at the University of Cape Town was convicted and sentenced for crimen injuria charges after filming and live streaming a colleague while she was expressing breast milk for her baby. On Thursday at the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court, Gavin Joe was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for three years on condition that he would make a payment of R4 000 to breast milk bank Milk Matters, do 120 hours of community service and would undergo therapy sessions for two years. In the plea agreement Joe admitted that he filmed Maggie Marx, without her knowledge, while she was expressing breast milk while at a training course at UCT’s Middle Campus in Rondebosch. In his plea Joe admitted to rearranging the break room, where he knew Marx would be expressing, with the purpose of capturing her expressing breast milk on a hidden camera. Marx had locked herself in the break room to ensure her privacy. “I took my cellphone and placed the phone in a cereal box. I further admit that I cut three holes in the cereal box and placed the phone, which I had connected to a power bank, in the cereal box. I admit that I then placed other condiments in front of the cereal box and positioned the only chair in the room in such a manner that the person sitting on the chair would be in full view of the camera. I admit I then programmed the phone to stream the recording to my PC. FULL STORY BELOW https://www.iol.co.za/capeargus/news/man-sentenced-for-filming-colleague-as-she-expressed-breast-milk-12946935
