A FEW HOURS AFTER THE BRUTAL MURDER OF SIAM LEE A FACEBOOK USER’S POST WENT VIRAL AND SOME CALLED FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE SICKENING POST – SOME EVEN CALLING FOR POLICE TO TAKE THE MAN IN FOR QUESTIONING.  FACEBOOK USER Dagan Nightalon POSTED A PICTURE OF SIAM LEE AND WROTE “WHEN YOU NAAI BEFORE BRAAI” FOLLOWED BY “I’M GOING TO HELL”  GREG VAN SCHAPER WROTE ” Very disgusted at the post this individual made on Facebook. This young lady was somebody’s daughter, family member and friend and probably had a very bright future ahead. I don’t know her personally but this post hurt me. Guys let me just state that rape and torture of women is no joke and real men need to stand firm against it and stick up for women.” BELOW IS PICTURES OF THE P.O.S – LETS MAKE HIM FAMOUS AND LET HIM MEET HIS FATE
