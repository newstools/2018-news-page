Pretoria – Chris Hani’s killer Janusz Walus has turned to the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, once again in his bid to be placed on parole and then deported to Poland.
He has served more than 24 years since starting his sentence in the Pretoria prison, now known as the Kgosi Mampuru II Prison, following the 1993 assassination of Hani. The court last year decided to grant Walus parole, but Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha took the matter on appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. It was referred back to Masutha. In November the minister once again turned down Walus’s application to be placed on parole. Walus, in papers filed with the high court, will ask for an order that the minister’s refusal be set aside, alternatively that the court order his release, subject to him being deported to Poland.
