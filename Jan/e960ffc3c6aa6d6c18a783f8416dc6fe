Yet another accident occurred yesterday afternoon (18 January) at the intersection of Koeberg and Oranje Streets. The intersection is infamous for drivers ignoring the stop sign. Elize Cordier, who has been residing in a house at the intersection for the past 22 years, caught the accident on her CCTV camera. Footage shows a cyclist riding down Koeberg Street being hit and flung through the air by a vehicle driving on Oranje Street. “Accidents are such a common occurrence here that we feel like paramedics. All our pleas for speed bumps have fallen on deaf ears,” said Cordier.
