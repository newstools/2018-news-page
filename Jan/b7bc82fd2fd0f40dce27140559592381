The Hawks have obtained warrants for the arrest of at least one of the Gupta brothers. The unit is now waiting for prosecutors at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to sign off the warrants so that the arrests can be effected. A senior Hawks official told City Press on Monday evening that a magistrate had issued warrants of arrest for at least one of the Gupta brothers as well as an undisclosed number of the family’s associates. However, he was unable to say which of the brothers face arrest or reveal the identity of their associates in the Hawks’ sights. The Gupta brothers include elder brother Ajay, as well as Atul, and the younger brother Rajesh, also known as Tony. City Press understands that the charges stem from former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s State of Capture report. Earlier on Monday afternoon, City Press reported that the Asset Forfeiture Unit was going after the Gupta family and their associates and was set to serve summons on them on Tuesday morning, to preserve assets of theirs worth R1.6 billion.
