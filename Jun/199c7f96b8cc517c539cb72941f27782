 Cameras were rolling when a sleepy driver reportedly slammed into a toll plaza on the Florida Turnpike earlier this month, sending a man flying in the air, WESH . The crash happened around 7:15 a.m. Saturday, June 3, near St. Cloud. In a released by the Florida Highway Patrol, a speeding car is seen striking a barrier in front of a toll lane. A man is flung out of the car and lands in another toll lane before the car catches fire. It took about 20 seconds for toll workers to notice someone was ejected. A trooper wrote in his that the driver appeared to be fatigued.
