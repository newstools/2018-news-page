In this video by ‘From South Africa’ we see Lekota in parliament very clearly putting Malema in his place over his absurd and irresponsible utterings and public incitement regarding the land issue. Lekota comes up in support of the South African farmers and the necessary food supply to the country. And this in relation to the increases in farm attacks and farm murders. He points out that the elected leaders of the country are responsible for their actions and the effect it has on the people and generations to come.  These content links are provided by Content.ad.
