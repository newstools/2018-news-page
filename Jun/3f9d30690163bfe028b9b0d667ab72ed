Sandton SPCA to the rescue – again! A heavily pregnant goat, savagely trussed up and carelessly tossed onto the back of a bakkie, was rescued by the Sandton SPCA. The severely distressed animal who had been lying in the parked vehicle outside a butchery in Cyrildene for two hours, had its front and back legs tethered so tightly that it restricted circulation and blood flow. But the butcher who first lied to the SPCA Inspectors that she was unaware of any goat on the premises, had to quickly change her story when the property was searched and the poor animal was eventually found in the vehicle. “The Sandton SPCA will not tolerate any animal cruelty. We are here to serve and protect our animals from abuse,” said Senior Inspector Jaco Pieterse, General Manager of the Sandton SPCA Charges of animal cruelty and obstruction have been laid at the Cleveland police station, where the goat owner is being detained and waiting to appear in court. The goat is being cared for at the Sandton SPCA. These content links are provided by Content.ad.
