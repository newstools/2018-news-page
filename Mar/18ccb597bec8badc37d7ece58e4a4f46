Displeased by the latest posturing of the Economic Freedom Fighters leader, on land expropriation without compensation and his hate speech of calling White South Africans degrading and unprintable names in Parliament,   COPE leader Mosiuoa Lekota has called on those pushing for land,  for a more sensible approach towards South Africa’s land issue amid calls from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to take land from white people without compensation. Lekota said that the claim that white people ‘stole the land’ from black people in South Africa is not correct, and that land ownership in this country (South Africa) is determined through decades of buying, selling, holistic and proper negotiations. “We, the so-called Bantu speaking South Africans, came from the North, from the Great Lakes, we over ran territory here which was occupied by the Khoi and the San. There was no title, we just occupied that land,” he said. “We were not even the original residents here. The people we call Baroa, the People of the South – Ba boroa, the People of the South, are originally  the Khoi, the people we found here.” The COPE leader said that black people should rid themselves of the view that all white people walking around own land – and those that do, bought it. The government can take the land back from them – but only if it shows a title deed saying “this is my land.”
