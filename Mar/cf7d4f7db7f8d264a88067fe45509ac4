A knife-wielding robber wearing a horror film Chucky mask burst into an office license and brutally attacked the shop assistant. Osbourne Walton had been released from prison just a week before he carried out the terrifying raid while brandishing an eight-inch knife. Walton stormed the shop in what appears to be a ‘Chucky’ mask – from the 1988 film Child’s Play – and launching a terrifying attack on the shopkeeper at Bal’s Wines in West Bromwich. But the would-be robber got more than he bargained for as the hero student working there refused to give in and fought back. Footage was shown at Wolverhampton Crown Court, the dramatic ordeal can be seen from the moment Walton, 36, entered the shop.
