The situation is acute for the Boer population. The many farm attacks, along with a dehumanizing rhetoric, have led the organization Genocide Watch to flag for heightened risk of genocide conducted against the Boer population. The Boers are facing an uncertain future, where the focus is on surviving rather than living. We want to highlight not just the severity of the situation, but most importantly convey the response of the Boers in relation to the risks that they are now facing. We at Palaestra Media now need your help to carry out a documentary film about the situation in South Africa. Visit our site at www.boerproject.com for more information.
