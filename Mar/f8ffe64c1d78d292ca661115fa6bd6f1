AS RECEIVED Truck capsized on R59 north just after Meyer str.. looting seem to be the order of the day! Some people are justifying this! It’s the same as if you have an accident. Is it ok for them to come and steal your belongings because you don’t need them anymore? Do not justify this behavior it is pure and simple theft! If it does not belong to you do not take it…
