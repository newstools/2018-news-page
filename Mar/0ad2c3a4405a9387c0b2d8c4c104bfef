Johannesburg – The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) on Friday slammed AfriForum for their views on land expropriation and the display of the old flag. Earlier this week, AfriForum’s private prosecution team, led by former State prosecutor Gerrie Nel, announced that they will be privately prosecuting Alexis Bizos – the son of world-renowned human rights advocate George Bizos. Last year Nel announced that the civil rights group had instituted legal action to prosecute former president Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane. This week Kriel said that although they were against the display of the flag, they felt that criminalising it would be going a step too far. “We don’t use the flag at any of our events and we are not in support of it, but banning it would be against freedom of speech and would make South Africa look like a police state. We won’t take a decision to challenge the court application today, but it is something we will consider,” said Kriel.  The statement concludes with: “Radical socio-economic transformation now or never!!”
