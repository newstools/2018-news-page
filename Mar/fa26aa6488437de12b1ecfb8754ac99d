Police in western Kentucky have shot and killed a man in January of 2017 who investigators say was armed with a knife and a long pole that he had been using to smash car windows. Kentucky State Police spokesman Lt. Kyle Nall said during a news conference that 43-year-old Charles Christopher McClure was fatally shot by a Fulton police officer after he refused to follow officers’ orders. Nall says the pole was between 3 feet and 4 feet long and appeared to be made out of metal. At least five vehicles had broken windows, including two police cruisers. His Lawyers said he had mental health issues and was upset he hadn’t been able to see his kids and claim the officers acted with unnecessary force. McClure’s family has sued the officer, the city of Fulton and Kentucky State Police investigators
