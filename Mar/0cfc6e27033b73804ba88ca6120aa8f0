According to the victim of an assault that took place on the premises of a Food Lover’s Market at Lenasia’s Trade Route Mall, he was beaten up because of a cap on the afternoon of Sunday, February 25, Rising Sun Lenasia reports. This after a video of a worker being beaten up in a fruit and vegetable store in Lenasia emerged on social media earlier this week. The victim, Banele Mdingazwe, says he had been instructed to wear a Food Lover’s branded cap by one of his senior co-workers while busy cutting a watermelon. When he replied that he would wear the cap as instructed after washing his hands, an argument allegedly ensued and resulted in him being pushed around by the co-worker. “Another co-worker then approached us and punched me in the face while I had a knife in my hand. He then attempted to grab the knife out of my hand, but before I knew it, the supervisor was strangling me,” Banele said.  Assault victim Banele Mdingazwe’s injuries.
