Cyril Ramaphosa is the new South African President promises to fight corruption and restore the country to stability. There is only one thing in his way. White Landowners “the original sin”  The video shows the return of a white farmer to Zimbabwe, where after the farms were forcefully taken by the government, the country, that was the food basket of Africa, was totally destroyed under the Mugabe regime. And they ended up starving. It also shows how the ANC government under Zuma has also driven South Africa into financial ruin. The new President, Ramaphosa has vowed to fight this corruption, however Ramaphosa also declares that the taking of land from the indigenous people “was the original sin” and he has vowed to confiscate white owned land without compensation. The epidemic of farm attacks and murders continues without real acknowledgement of the crisis by the government. A Zimbabwe repeat. South Africa Today – South Africa Media
