In Ravena, New York, a small town outside of Albany, New York, a shocking instance of animal abuse was documented on video. Bryanna Catucci shared two disturbing videos on her Facebook profile of police officers INTENTIONALLY RUNNING OVER a terrified raccoon in a Shop and Save grocery store parking lot. The police claim they received reports that the animal was rabid, however, there doesn’t seem to be any confirmation or indication that that was the case – other than the fact the animal was spotted outside during daytime. “Leaving the grocery store to find 2 cops charging at a raccoon in a car for 15 minutes until dead,” Bryanna shared on her Facebook. Other Shop and Save customers saw the incident as well as were in shock over how abusive the police were.
