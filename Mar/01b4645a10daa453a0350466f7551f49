The civil rights organisation AfriForum wrote an open letter in September 2017, to the then Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa,, in which the organisation asked for clarification on the following statement attributed to him by the late Dr Mario Oriani Ambrosini in the latter’s memoirs: “In his brutal honesty, Ramaphosa told me of the ANC’s 25 year strategy to deal with the whites: it would be like boiling a frog alive, which is done by raising the temperature very slowly. Being cold blooded, the frog does not notice the slow temperature increase, but if the temperature is raised suddenly, the frog will jump out of the water. He meant that the black majority would pass laws transferring wealth, land, and economic power from white to black slowly and incrementally, until the whites lost all they had gained in South Africa, but without taking too much from them at any given time to cause them to rebel or fight.” AfriForum considers these statements extremely concerning and requested the Deputy President to confirm whether or not it accurately reflected his position.
