Every Criminal has his day…… these suspects decided to go on a house breaking spree this evening starting in Westdene and ending abruptly in Newlands. After robbing a house in westdene earlier they proceeded to rob another home in Newlands where they were spotted by the homeowner and a short high speed chase ensued. Whilst the suspects are talented house breakers their driving skills are much to be desired and they crashed badly on the Cnr of 10th and Du Preez street newlands. 2 suspects required medical treatment and have been transported to hospital under police guard whilst 1 is still on the run.
