Security Video Camera footage were posted to social media about a fight that took place at Tracers Biker’s Pub on Friday night in Middelburg, Mpumalanga where two biker brothers, Chris-Lee en Lean Venter brutally assaulted a middle-aged couple. According to the owner of the Pub, Isabell Rabie, the two brothers have been banned from the Pub some time ago. They are both Members of the Wheels in the Sky Biker Club. The Venter brothers accused Mobserver.co.za for only showing parts of the footage and that it portrayed only the video which made them look bad. However, Mobserver managed to get the full video where it can be seen that a snooker ball is thrown to the boelie-bikers only after the initial fight and not before the fighting game. The video shows how two big young men assault a middle-aged couple while other motorbike club members try to stop them. Chris-Lee Venter Lean ‘Botterbul’ Venter
