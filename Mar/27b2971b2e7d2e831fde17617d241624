AS RECEIVED A quiet day at the farm, suddenly your dog disappeared, you search, search, and see something floundering in the water, when you will see, a baby anaconda picked up your dog as an afternoon snack. Rapidly the villagers took the snake out of the water, unrolled it, and with paotas removed the dog from its claws. If they did not see it in time, the dog would be dead by then.
