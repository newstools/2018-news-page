Although the EFF’s motion was successfully passed with a majority vote, the EFF retaliated against the DA by tabling a motion of no confidence in DA Mayor Athol Trollip in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro as punishment… “because we want to teach these white people that we mean business when we say expropriation of land without compensation”. Malema said when someone “hurts you” you have to touch them back where it will hurt most, and that the DA love Trollip most. Malema said the DA “can go to hell” and that “we are going to remove a mayor of PE… we are going for your white man in PE. We are going to cut the throat” which the DA says was referring to DA Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) Mayor, Athol Trollip. Refiloe Nt’sekhe, DA National Spokesperson, said in a statement Thursday that Malema’s statements are nothing short of hate speech and go as far as an incitement to violence. He said the DA condemns the comments in the “strongest terms” and that it will report Malema to the Equality Court in terms of Section 10 of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act. Nt’sekhe said: “Furthermore, the EFF’s threat to remove the Mayor Trollip from the helm of NMB is a clear case of the EFF cutting off its nose to spite its face. Malema himself stated that the move to get rid of Mayor Trollip is not “because he stole the money or anything” or in an effort to improve the lives of the people in NMB. “The fact is that the EFF is willing to sacrifice the delivery of services and hand over NMB to the same corrupt and ineffective ANC the people of Port Elizabeth voted out of power. “The only people who will suffer the consequences of the EFF’s cheap politicking will be the residents of NMB. The EFF is effectively attempting to reverse all the good work the DA-led coalition has done, and hand NMB back to the ANC on a silver platter.” According to the DA, NMB has made great strides under the DA-led coalition, including exposing ANC corruption; recovering millions of rands through freezing corrupt contracts; connecting over 12 000 residents to running water and toilets for the first time; and creating 8 000 Expanded Public Works (EPWP) job. The DA said that Malema’s accusation that the DA is not “appreciating the pain that comes with the brutal land dispossession” is a blatant attempt by Malema to distort the DA’s commitment to redressing the history of violent land dispossession of black South Africans. “The EFF’s policy of land reform will not serve those who have been disposed of land. Their proposal will mean that all land, no matter who owns it, will be given to the State. “The DA is completely committed to land reform policies which will enable the poor and marginalised to access and truly own land, and not a policy which will undermine economic prosperity. “The DA will not be held ransom by the EFF’s attempts to get back into bed with the ANC,” said Nt’sekhe. Trollip tweeted: “There is nothing I can do about the color of my skin! I can’t and won’t change it for anyone.” [WATCH] Earlier today #EFF leader Julius #Malema on why his party will be going forward with attempts to get rid of the DA’s Port Elizabeth Mayor Athol Trollip.                          : @Ihsaan_Haffo pic.twitter.com/tW7NWb9JQQ — EWN Reporter (@ewnreporter) February 28, 2018
