Deputy President David Mabuza has told Parliament during his first question session in the National Assembly that land must be returned to the landless. Mabuza took to the podium this week for his maiden outing in his new post in Parliament on Tuesday to answer six questions and their follow-ups in the House. This is the stress that our people are facing, that means we can no longer avoid these questions that are confronting ourselves. “If we want to survive as a nation, we can no longer protect the status quo. “Land must be given back to the rightful owners. Land is a means to help people survive.” ‘We don’t seek reverse discrimination’ When asked on Sunday afternoon about his thoughts on farm attacks, Mabuza spoke to Pretoria Tribune and told journalists that he doesn’t really believe that he does not really believe that farm attacks really exist,” they are a myth created by white people to make black leaders look bad. I have personally never witnessed a farm attack.”, he said. “White people don’t want to see a black person succeed, that’s why they are creating all this nonsense”, he said according to source. Mabuza says white media promotes stories of farm attacks to ruin the image of black people, so that they as whites, can get back into power.
