This is what happened tonight at the Nelson Mandela University Xerox Stadium. SASCO members beating up security and rugby players and assaulting women. In the videos, spot the SRC President and various other SASCO members. Complaints brought forward are those of race quota and that fewer black people were on the field. SASCO proves to be champions of fists rather than champions of students issues that we face at the university. Hundreds of students still await the response for the My Mandela Fund. Phof besilinde ntoni? Nantsi iSASCO esiyaziyo thina. A Varsity Cup rugby game was cancelled after a group of people stormed onto the pitch and violence broke out on Monday night.
