A woman fought off a carjacker inside the cab of a moving truck with her 2-year-old child inside on Wednesday afternoon in Bremerton, Washington, police say. Video of the incident captured by a surveillance camera shows a shirtless man run up to the truck, while the woman was outside. The suspect entered the car and closed the door. The woman was behind the truck when she noticed and rushed to open the door and jump inside. The video shows the truck lurch forward, then backward before turning sharply to the left and driving across the street and onto the sidewalk. The 24-year-old suspect, who reportedly punched the woman in the face, then ran from the vehicle. The entire incident lasted less than 30 seconds. Bremerton Police Department
