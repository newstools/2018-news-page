Ok, so you’re pulling into your driveway after a long day’s work with your loved one. Suddenly you notice someone running towards your car with a gun and a hammer, what do you do? The answer for most people is nothing, during this Pretoria hijacking, though, things went down differently. CCTV footage of an attempted hijacking at Woodlands Lifestyle Estate has gone viral this week as it actually shows criminals not getting away with it. In the video, a dark SUV can be seen pulling up behind another car into the entrance to the estate. Seconds later, another car arrives and two men jump out of the sedan and run towards the SUV. Some sort of altercation takes place off camera and the next thing you know, the two hijackers are almost falling over trying to run back to their car. The hijackers were so keen to get away that they literally ran past the getaway car. No time for cars to get going when Brad Redmayne could be breathing down your neck.  TimesLIVE reached out to Redmayne, the man in the SUV, in order to find out what happened off camera that sent the criminals into a panic. “As I turned around and saw the guy holding a hammer and he was wearing a balaclava mask‚ I twisted in my seat‚ reached to pull up my shirt and draw my firearm‚” Redmayne said. “At that point they saw what I was doing and then he must have alerted the second guy who was coming towards the car and then they ran off.” Redmayne, who was in the car with his partner, said people should be prepared in order to not be the victim. “If you’re the victim‚ they will pick up on that and you will be a victim.” Whatever you do, folks, always remember that things don’t always turn out as well as they did for Brad. Stay safe.
