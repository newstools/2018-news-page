The owner of Forest Acres Liquor Store has released graphic surveillance
video showing a violent run-in with an armed robber. Tulsa police responded to the store near 12th and Memorial just after 6 p.m. Thursday
after the clerk called 911, saying they shot the suspect multiple
times. The suspect was gone by the time officers arrived, but he later
showed up at a local hospital.
