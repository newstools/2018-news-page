Russian firefighters from the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) rescued a cat in Volgograd by performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and using pressurised oxygen from a canister, Monday. A massive fire broke out in a Volgograd apartment earlier in the day. Firefighters found the barely breathing cat on a stairwell near the door of a flat. They carried the pet outdoors, where they found its owner crying hysterically for her beloved pet. Firefighters opened an oxygen tank for the cat to breathe in the life-giving gas. One of the rescuers pumped the felineâ€™s chest for some time before the cat finally came back to life. The owner left the scene pressing the shocked, but very much alive cat close to her chest.
