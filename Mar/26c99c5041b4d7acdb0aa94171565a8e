Jane said she had submitted 5 farm attacks exclusive news in the past 4 month and they were not aired on radio or broadcasted on TV.  When she asked why her reports never reached the people her bosses told her that her reports are not good for the country’s image and told her to never bother with farm attacks. “THEY TOLD ME THEY DESTROYED THE TAPES AND IF I LOVE MY JOB I SHOULD NOT USE THEIR RESOURCES ON NEWS THAT DOESN’T DESERVE TO BE BROADCASTED” “I’ve been working as a reporter for 3 years and noticed how a lot of farm attacks does not get coverage and only appears online, I also leaked some of my stories only line just to make people get a glimpse of what our farmers are going through”. Said Jane.
