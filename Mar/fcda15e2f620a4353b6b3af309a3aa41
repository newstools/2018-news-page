When a group of four men went to Mr.  Kobus van Heerden’s farm in Kiepersol-Hazyview on Sunday night, they did not know they were making the biggest mistake of their lives. Four heavily armed men intruded a farm owned by a 69 year old man and his wife in Hazyview and tried to break into their house. Fortunately, Mr.  Van Heerden had more guns than they did,  so bullets began flying in every direction. The old farmer managed to first take down three suspects before taking down the last one which was trying to run for its life after seeing that he is on the losing side. With the help of his dog, Mr.  Van Heerden chased him down and finally got a clear shot and took him down. The brave farmer then called the police who are still on site investigating the incident. More details to follow.
