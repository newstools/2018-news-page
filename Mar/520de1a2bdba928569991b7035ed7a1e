The farmer (35) had just arrived home when he was attacked by two men, one armed with a firearm, the other with a knife. The suspects tied him up with rope and entered the house. He managed to get free and fought back. He was stabbed several time with a sharp object and was later rushed to hospital. At this stage his condition is not known. The police, members of Heritage protection Group (HPG) and farmers were on the trail of the suspects in an attempt to arrest them. This attack comes on the heels of another attack where Jasper von Kleist (57), a foreman on a farm in the Tom Burke area was murdered and his friend Sonja Joubert was wounded. The owner of the farmâ€™s son Charlie Solomon was also shot and wounded.
