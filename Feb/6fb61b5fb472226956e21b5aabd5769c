This is the terrifying a moment a group of tourists on a walking safari were charged by an angry African elephant. The video shows tourists taking photographs of some browsing elephants near Zulu Nyala Game Lodge in South Africa, when one charges. Guide William quickly springs into action, cocking his gun, shouting at the elephant and telling the visitors to retreat slowly. When the animal continues to charge, William points the gun at the creature and shouts loudly for it to go away. Metres away from the terrified tourists, the animal finally halts its charge and then backs away. As heroic guide William leads the group on through the South African bush, the filmer asks: “Anyone need a nappy (diaper)?” Although the clip was filmed in 2014, it has only recently emerged online.
