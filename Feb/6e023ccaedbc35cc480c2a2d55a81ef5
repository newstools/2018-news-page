A video has been circulating on social media, which seems to set new heights to human cruelty. It shows a man (presumably the father) beating a small girl while a small boy is suspended from a rope. Despite all talks of” caring for our children”, India has one of the most reported cases of child abuse, while countless cases go unreported. Even the stringent POSCO seems toothless in front of monsters like these, who could be found in every nook and corner of the country. Team The Voice Raiser, Kundan Srivastava requests the community to provide any further details about this video and the people in it, so that some action could be taken. Updates: The case belongs to Rajsamand, Rajasthan. If any resident of the city come up with the updates regarding this case, it would be appreciated.
