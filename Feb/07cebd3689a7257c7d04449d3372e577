RUSTENBURG – Fourteen South African police officers have been arrested for corruption along the Mozambican border, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said on Friday in Emanguzi in KwaZulu-Natal. “We arrested 14 police officers who were suspects in criminal activity and corruption along the border… we brought in a new a police force into this place.” Mbalula visited Emanguzi earlier this month following protests by the community due to cross-border crimes. After he listened to the people during the visit, he made an undertaking to go back with a comprehensive strategy to deal with matters raised. He said a fence would be erected alongside the border to make it difficult for criminals to cross into Mozambique with vehicles.
