I was outnumbered and I heard them talk about stabbing me‚” he said. “I’m ashamed … obviously I was in the wrong. I shouldn’t have done that and I messed up. I should have walked away.” The man said that the tense standoff could be traced back to when they had arrived at the bar. A fight understood to be fueled by race tensions at a bar in Hillcrest.

I approached them in the bar because I wanted to know what they had said to me. They got a little bit cheeky and they went outside and I was under the influence.” He said that all he wanted to do was walk away from the situation. “I wanted to walk away and I just retaliated after he wouldn’t let me leave. I went to the police station but I haven’t reported it … I wanted to know if he had reported it.” – ARTICLE WRITTEN BY JEFF WICKS wicksj@tisoblackstar.co.za
