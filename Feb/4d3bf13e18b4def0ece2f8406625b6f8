This is the shocking moment two men stole the bike of a 14-year-old boy in broad daylight in a public park. Mobile phone footage was captured by a teenage schoolgirl as the robbery took place on Braunstone Park at about 3.40pm on Tuesday. And the victim’s mother Nicola Warner has now described how son George had his bike taken by two men who threatened him and his friends. Nicola, of Braunstone Town, said: “George was not home by his usual time so I called him and he told me his bike had been stolen and he was talking to the police. “I rushed up to the park to see him and he was still shaking. He was very upset by the robbery. “I can’t believe how people can be so cowardly and despicable; to take the bike off a child and threaten him and his friends. It’s awful.”
