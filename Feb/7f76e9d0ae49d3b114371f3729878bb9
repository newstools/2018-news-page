This video is of a towing company in Newcastle in Ncandu Park called Atlas Towing towed our car during an accident without our agreement verbal or written and got a policeman to lie on the statement saying we gave them permission to tow our car. The guy you hear on the video is the owner of the company and he was being racist towards us saying black people messed this country in a previous call. Now they are demanding R2500 from us and R350 from the day the car was in their possession. On top of that they are in collusion with police, who then defend them.
