DURBAN – There has been a twist in the Hillcrest pub racist assault video which went viral on social media last week. CCTV footage released to the Sunday Tribune by Lazy Lizard pub shows that Nthando Gumede, 21, who was knocked out in the assault, had tried to attack his assailant before he was elbowed in the face. The initial cellphone video clip that went viral last week only showed this final part of the altercation between Gumede and Kyle McKay. The CCTV footage from the pub also reveals that McKay was allegedly provoked before the assault and repeatedly tried to walk away. The footage shows Gumede being aggressive towards McKay and Gumede’s friends trying to control the situation. https://www.iol.co.za/sunday-tribune/news/watch-new-twist-to-alleged-racist-assault-incident-at-hillcrest-pub-13222339
