: The Groenland Water Users Association in the Overberg says it will next week release between eight and ten million cubic metres of water into the Western Cape supply netwerk. This translates to about a billion litre of water. Cape Town’s consumption is more than 500 million liter per day Chief Executive officer of GWUA, Johan Groenewald says the water is a donation from farmers in Elgin and Grabouw and comes mainly from the Eikenhof water scheme and private dams in the Upper Kogelberg catchment area. He says negotiations started in October last year. Groenewald says the water will be pumped into the Palmiet river from where it will flow by canal to the upper Steenbras dam that supplies water to the Cape Town municipality. “It’s out of the Groenland water users catchment area and it’s a once off voluntary ceding that will be released over a period of about a month. We can’t release everything at once because they cant take all the 10 million at one stage.”
