A woman was on a Taxify trip to meet her boyfriend for dinner this past weekend when, after making suggestive comments to her throughout the trip, her unnamed Taxify driver tried to coerce her into looking at his exposed sausage. The woman said the driver made conversation with her the minute she entered the car, asking where she was going and who she was meeting. The woman added, “Then he started making remarks about my lips, how they look nice, and made comments about how he can see himself ejaculating inside of me, which is when he asked me if I want to see his hotdog. At this point I saw that he was actually serious.” In a panic, she started texting her boyfriend telling him to hurry up. She also texted her best friend to alert her about the driver. Her friend advised her to take a video, while keeping calm so as to not elicit a violent reaction from the driver.
