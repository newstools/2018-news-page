A speeding Bentley Continental GT appears suddenly from nowhere and smashes into a 4X4 spinning the vehicle 360 degrees into a garden wall. The dramatic 85mph collision, captured in this terrifying dash cam footage, happened along a 20mph road in picturesque Old Amersham in the Chiltern Hills. Miraculously the driver of the Ford 4Ã—4, pensioner Tim Edwards, survived the horror crash. The driver of the Bentley, Richard Plum, 46, fled on foot but was traced by the blood left on the airbag of his car. He pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and failing to stop after a road accident and was jailed for 14 months with a driving ban of four years and seven months.
