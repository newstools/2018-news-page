A male teacher has been removed from a school after pictures of him and a female pupil in a compromising situation circulated on social media. Both the teacher and the pupil are from the same West Rand school, which canâ€™t be named to protect the identity of the girl. In the picture, the teacher is wearing pyjamas while the pupil is wearing a T-shirt. The two pose for a selfie in front of a full-length mirror, with the teacher hugging the girl from behind. Gauteng Education Department spokesperson Steve Mabona confirmed they were aware of the pictures and that the teacher had been removed from the school. https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/news/teacher-in-trouble-over-selfie-with-pupil-13171561
