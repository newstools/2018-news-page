East coast radio fans and Facebook users called for the axing of Executive producer Rory Petzer following his post which suggests that The saps members killed innocent men on Friday night in the eastern cape following the massacre of 5 police officers, the post read And now bitches are cheering because seven suspects were shot dead and ten were injured in a shootout in Ngcobo between SAPS and men believed to behind cop killings. People are clapping on social media and giving each other high fives. I have a few things to say to these people: 1. These were men BELIEVED TO BE behind the cop killings. When was their trial? How sure are you these were the guilty guys? One day you’ll be walking past a car and believed to hijacking it and then shot dead and then social media will celebrate your death. 2. Too many people dead already in what has now essentially been transformed from an ‘incident’ into a ‘war’. 3. One day you might be walking past when one of these bloody shootouts for which you so fervently call takes place and be caught in the cross fire. Stray bullets are terrifying because there are seldom convictions for those. 4. Let’s play nicely and not celebrate the death of anyone. 5. I have lots more to say, but I’m sure you get my point. Hugs.           Over 50 people commented on the post with no response from Rory, a Female reader wrote “who is the bitches you referring to??” another wrote “Firstly, lucky for me I no longer listen to ECR they are not worth my time. Secondly, you comment as if you were there. Sadly, you were not, or else you would have been the one running away like a coward unlike the policeman and women who face this everyday and who either shoot the suspect or get shot. A policeman was shot in this incident and I would rather like to see people support him instead of killers. Thirdly, I wonder if you have ever been in the same situation as the cops. I have and I have had to do what I can to firstly, to survive and secondly, to ensure the criminals never hurt people like you again. I have lost my sister to suspects like this, she was shot, suffered 10yrs and where were people like you on the radio no where because just like the City of Durban and the so called honorable major and the departments who should support disabled cops, you abandoned her and not one of you so called politicians, Managers, or DJs on ECR cares, unless it affects you. Good luck to you in the future you live in a dream world. To all those cops, security personnel and community members out there still doing their best respect and salute to everyone of you. Again, I know I make the best decision every day listen to better DJs who are real and support those who are there to protect, serve and save them from killers.” some comments even suggests that East Coast Radio should be boycotted and a criminal case be laid against Petzer’s comments. a Ecr fan wrote on the Durban radio station’s facebook wall “Hope ECR (my favorite radio station) does not support Rory Petzer in his ridiculous comments!!!” More to follow
