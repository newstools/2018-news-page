JOHANNESBURG – The Hawks arrested eight suspects in connection with a bank robbery that took place in April this year. They were arrested in Klerksdorp and Upington. Two of the suspects work for a bank. Hawks North West spokesperson Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said suspects allegedly colluded and stole more than R3-million at a local Nedbank branch. She said two suspects allegedly posed as SBV security officers to do a routine pickup and produced fake documents and were handed money by the bank staff. “Following the robbery, an intelligence-driven Hawks operation, assisted by the Gauteng technical response team, led to the arrest of Welcome Marcus, 50, and Charles Anthony Scheepers, 54, two weeks ago. On Sunday the operation continued and led to the arrest of a further six, two of whom are employed by the bank. The Hawks’ Priority Crime Specialised Investigations unit is already conducting a financial and asset forfeiture probe on all the suspects,” said Rikhotso. All eight suspects are due to appear at the Klerksdorp magistrate on Tuesday on charges of theft. eNCA These content links are provided by Content.ad.
