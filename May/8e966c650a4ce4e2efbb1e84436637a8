SuperSport have posted a tweet confirming they are “aware of the on-air incident” that stunned listeners on Saturday evening. Ashwin Willemse walked off set following an apparent disagreement with fellow presenters Nick Mallett and Naas Botha after the Lions win over the Brumbies. It’s not clear what raised Willemse’s ire, but he said he was labelled a “quota player” and refused to be “patronized by two individuals who played in an apartheid / segregated era”. Willemse went on to say he “can’t work with people who undermine other people” and that he was “glad it happened on live TV so that people can see”. It was always going to happen on Live television. Ashwin Willemse i am so glad you finally put Nick Mallet and Naas Botha in their Place. @robertmarawa @Sbu_Mjikeliso @Couch_Krit @ntsabomluleki @ThabisoSithole @Veli_Mbuli #sonofthesoil  pic.twitter.com/mtLHDTAiq0 — ThandoManana (@TandoManana) May 19, 2018  These content links are provided by Content.ad.
