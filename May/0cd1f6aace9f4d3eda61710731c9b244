A bellicose bully slapped a 94-year-old Queens man in the face then stomped on the elderly man’s spectacles after the squabble on the victim’s stoop, police said Saturday. Surveillance footage shows the cold-hearted brute arguing with the nonagenarian from the sidewalk outside the victim’s home on 35th Ave. near 97th St. in Corona around 12:15 p.m. Friday. The two men bickered back and forth for about 30 seconds before the senior gestured for the unwanted visitor to get lost. His shooing only further enraged his adversary, who walked to the foot of the stoop to continue his harassment. The cane-carrying victim pushed the bully back when he reached the top step. The assailant slapped him with an open palm that sent the victim’s glasses flying to the sidewalk. The feisty victim swung his cane at his attacker after the slap, the shows. The attacker descended the steps, stomped on the victim’s glasses and stormed off. The elderly victim cut his nose in the attack but refused medical attention, officials said. He does not recall the details of the dispute or whether he knows the man who attacked him These content links are provided by Content.ad.
