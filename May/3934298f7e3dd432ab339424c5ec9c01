A Thai taxi driver kicked a German tourist in the head in an unprovoked attack in Pattaya, Thailand, on May 16, 2018. Andreas Bruer, the German tourist, was riding a moped when police pulled him over and fined him for not having a license. Officers clamped the front wheel of the moped, but as Andreas tried to drag it away, a taxi driver named Sunthorn Saengkham kicked him in the head. Saengkham was later arrested and charged with assault for the unprovoked attack on the tourist. Saengkham told officers that he believed Bruer was trying to flee the scene and wanted to “stop him from running away.” But Lt. Col. Chaningan Panpinit, the deputy inspector of the Pattaya City Police Department, said that the taxi driver had “overreacted” and was fined for assault. These content links are provided by Content.ad.
