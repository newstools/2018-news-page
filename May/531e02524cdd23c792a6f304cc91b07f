AS RECEIVED This is simply a must watch and the speech by this broken man made me very sad because he was like my father speaking, speaking with sorrow and pain . I was inboxed this video by a friend who knew the man speaking – Dr Duncan Prinsloo . According to my friend, Dr Prinsloo’s wife Letitia was a very soft person and led his wife to God when they were young teachers . Dr Prinsloo and his wife were shot in their beds by farm attackers . The dogs were poisoned and the trellidor was broken open .
Dr Prinsloo’s daughter was in another room and called her brother who sped through from Pretoria and did mouth to mouth resusitation, but Letitia died that night . Dr Prinsloo’s body was broken by the bullets but his spirit is unbroken and uncaptured . The farm attackers wanted them off the farm, he is still there .
