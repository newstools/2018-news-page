Following the continuing restlessness by EFF Julius Malema and the Black Land First leaders jointly demanding for a return of the land, a new group comprising of Khoi Khoi descendants have issued a lengthy white paper detailing the true situation of the land transition and ownership. According to the groups spokesperson Hung Sangawe, who vehemently warned  Malema to go back to Ethiopia were it is alleged he has biological roots. “White people didn’t steal the land, other black tribes invaded it’ The so-called Bantu speaking South Africans, came from the North, from the Great Lakes, they over ran territory here which was occupied by the Khoi and the San. There was no title, we just occupied that land,” he said. “These people  were not even the original residents here. The people we call Baroa, the People of the South – Ba boroa, the People of the South, are originally  the Khoi, the first people  here.” Sangawe further reiterated that  black people should rid themselves of the view that all white people walking around own land – and those that do, bought it. The government can take the land back from them – but only if it shows a title deed saying “this is my land.” Some have alleged that Malema has biological roots in Ethiopia, but was unduly  using his privilege and influence as a lawmaker to intimidate and strip people of their legitimate assets. He further submitted that if this grab continues unabated, a serious legal suit will be instituted as South Africa was a nation governed by laid down laws and not arbitrary sentiments. Details of the white paper  communique will be published shortly.
