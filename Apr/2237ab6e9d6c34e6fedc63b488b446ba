PRETORIA – South Africa’s plan to expropriate land without compensation in order to redress racial disparities in land ownership would target mainly unused land, a senior official with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) reveals. As part of long-promised reforms, the ANC in December adopted a resolution to expropriate land without compensation for redistribution to landless black South Africans, provided this was done in a manner that does not threaten food security or undermine economic growth. Land ownership remains a highly emotive subject more than two decades after the end of apartheid. Whites still own most of South Africa’s land. Moves towards land expropriation have also worried markets and economists and farming groups have warned of a potentially devastating impact on the agricultural sector. David Masondo, a member of the ANC’s Economic Transformation Committee, said the aim of the resolution was not to target “all land that is productively utilised … but use it or lose it, even if you are black.” “It includes vacant land, unused land, and land used for speculative purposes” he said. Responding to this,  South African archbishop Desmond Tutu said on Thursday that there is no reason why a nation should be divided because of land . “Land, whether used or not, belongs to God, not to blacks or whites. So the people of South Africa must not be divided by this.  No one owns the land.” he said.
