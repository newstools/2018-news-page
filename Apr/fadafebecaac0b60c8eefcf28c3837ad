Hillsborough County Deputies are looking for a man who punched a stranger twice with brass knuckles, then left the scene. On March 31 at about 2:51 p.m., a man approached a Hillsborough County home and rang the door bell. As the victim answered, two dogs ran out of the house. The suspect told the homeowner he was trying to find someone who didn’t live there. While he was trying to retrieve the dogs, the suspect used brass knuckles and punched the man twice in the face and left the scene as a passenger in a silver small four door vehicle. The suspect is described as a black male with a light complexion. He is about 6’1″ 200 lbs., with a muscular build and a tattoo on his right bicep. He was last seen wearing a blue baseball hat, blue t-shirt and light blue jeans and blue athletic shoes carrying brass knuckles.
