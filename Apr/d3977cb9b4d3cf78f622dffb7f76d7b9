According to Britain, you cannot have land expropriation without compensation. It is illegal in international law. It is contrary to a dozen treaties that South Africa has signed and ratified. As such, it is a principle that is also enshrined in South African domestic law. You can not change the Constitution therefore to make it legal – Treaty law is superior law, it always applies. The proposal, if directed at land held by the white community, would also contravene half a dozen international treaties, notably those condemning apartheid, that South Africa since the ANC took power, has signed and ratified. So no, it can not be done. When Mugabe tried this, the point was litigated. These were the legal conclusions. Now, Mugabe pushed ahead, so what happened? Zimbabwe crashed. Julius Malema addresses the issue of land again on Friday and made it clear that his party is going forward with land grabs,  because international laws do not apply in South Africa. “International Laws Only Apply To International Countries Like The US and England, not South Africa,We Are Proceeding As Planned” Malema said.
