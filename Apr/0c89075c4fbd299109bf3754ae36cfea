Hundreds of thieves made a clean getaway after looting an overturned lorry of its load of washing powder as police watched on helplessly. The lorry was full of boxes of MAQ brand washing powder when it overturned in the Midvaal municipality of north-eastern South Africa’s Gauteng Province. A video shot by a passenger in a passing car shows hundreds of people at the scene, with many standing on the side of the felled lorry. Many vehicles are parked nearby as people pull over to help themselves to the free goods. A police officer is seen talking to a driver but he seems powerless to stop the looting frenzy going on behind him. More than 43,000 people saw the video within 24 hours of it being filmed. Some commenters raged at the lawlessness of the mob when presented with an opportunity to steal. Odp Bothma wrote: “It shows the lack of integrity, discipline, and moral compass!!!!! Civilized people do not behave like this!!!!!!!” Bettie Wentzel even suggested the “accident” had been caused deliberately, writing: “Apparently these types of accidents are being instigated in order to be robbed. I mean, come on! it’s a straight road!” It was not reported whether the unnamed lorry driver was injured, and the total value of the goods he was carrying is not known. It was not clear whether police had taken any action against any looters.
