EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu has demanded privatization of water, thereby disregarding human rights. Commenting on the water issue faced by the Western Cape and other regions in South Africa, Shivambu said he believes the answer to global water issues lies in privatization. “People should be denied the rights to access water and pay for it instead.” Shivambu said in Pretoria on Sunday. According to different news sources, Shivambu said in a statement, “Water is not a public right and the EFF should control  South Africa’s supply of water so we can sell it back to the people to generate profit for the government” Shivambu says the South African government is failing, miserably, to supply water to the people of South Africa, and should therefore hand the responsibility over to the EFF.
