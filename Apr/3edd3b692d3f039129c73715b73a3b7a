The Minister of police sent the information and we are currently doing a threat assessment. We are taking these threats in a very serious light,” said Naidoo. The EFF issued a statement on Tuesday night about the party’s concern over the safety of Malema. The party said it has been alerted to plans underway to assassinate Malema which may involve hired assassinators with connections to drug dealers in various provinces. Acting EFF spokesperson Tebogo Mokwele said the party believes these threats are real and has insinuated that they may stem from the party’s political growth in the North West province. “The covert plans come from reliable sources who indicate that a small group of politically insecure and insane individuals from the North West Province have approached drug dealers and assassins in different provinces, particularly in the Western Cape to assassinate EFF President,” said Mokwele. “The EFF has also worked on strengthening of internal security because we are aware that cowards, who have no convincing alternate political programme against the EFF, are now resorting to thoughts of violent and fatal suppression of a genuine political alternative,” she said. The ANC governs the North West and the EFF believes the people making the threats against Malema may be from the ANC. “The ruling party is known for internal political killings to suppress its own members and activists, and it looks like they now intend to export the political killings to other political parties,” said Mokwele.
