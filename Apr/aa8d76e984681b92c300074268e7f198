Learn More According to the info I got, this happened in the Philippines. The video shows a woman, apparently high on drugs, naked on top of a utility pole. She keeps messing around, grabbing various wires and moving from a wire to a wire. Eventually, after climbing to the top of the pole, she grabs the wrong live wire, gets zapped and goes limp. Seconds later, her naked body falls to the ground and lands half spread eagle with snatch pointed at the camera. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO
