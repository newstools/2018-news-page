The banana farm that used to have over 100 permanent employees had fired 60 during the last four years under the new management. The whole time the farm depended on government funding and it have never turned profit. The farm products had never met the market minimum standards so the same workers who works in the farm are responsible for selling the bananas on weekends for profit. The workers have not been paid in two years now and they figured they only way to get paying jobs is to give the farm back to the previous owner. “The neighboring farms are doing good as usual but our farm is mess, I’m tire of working without pay and soon there will be nothing to do in this farm because the trees are dying”. Said one of the workers.
