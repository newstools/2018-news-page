by JACK MONTGOMERY8 Apr 20183891 Historic England, the public body tasked with preserving England’s heritage, is advertising paid training placements for itself, the National Trust, English Heritage and other bodies which are not open to white people. “We’re excited to offer a number of training placements for undergraduates or recent graduates (graduated within the last 18 months),” begins the advert, which is illustrated with a picture of a hijabi Muslim — before the kicker: “If you’re interested in gaining skills and experience for a career in heritage and identify as having Black, Asian or other Minority Ethnic Heritage or mixed heritage (jump to Background to find out why), please see how to apply below.” The ‘background’ section of the advert explains how the Tory government published a Culture White Paper in March 2016 which “challenged Historic England and other nationally funded cultural organisations to develop and share strategies for improving workforce diversity.” It explains how, “In response, Historic England developed a Workforce Diversity Strategy which has several strands of activity but one of the most significant is a new paid Heritage Training Placements scheme for undergraduates and recent graduates with Black, Asian or other Minority Ethnic Heritage.” The result is that the paid training placements — which are being offered not only at Historic England but also other public bodies including the National Trust, the Heritage Alliance, and English Heritage — are not actually open to applicants of English heritage. We’re excited to offer a number of paid training placements for undergraduates or recent graduates at 13 locations across England Find out more and apply here: bit.ly/2pSeNhj
Social justice policies of this nature are extremely popular with Prime Minister Theresa May, who has also declared a crusade against the “burning injustice” of the arguably fictitious gender pay gap. White Britons have also been from applying for lucrative paid internships at the and ITV’s Peston on Sunday programme recently, and even prevented from attending recruitment workshops run by the British Transport Police. This is despite the fact that the White British working-class actually have the poorest life outcomes of any ethnic group in the country by several measures, with Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner recently having to admit that the focus on “race and women’s agendas” has had a negative on white working-class boys, in particular.
