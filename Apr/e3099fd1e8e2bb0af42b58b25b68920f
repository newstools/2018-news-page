Khoi San leaders in South Africa have made the story of land ownership in the country clear. Speaking to news sources on Wednesday afternoon, a group of elders led by Piet Barendse of Khomani San said :”Malema must stop talking nonsense, He knows nothing about the land he is trying to claim and grab. White people didn’t steal the land, that’s why they have papers to prove it. Khoi Sans were here first, other black tribes invaded this land” The so-called Bantu speaking South Africans, came from the North, from the Great Lakes, they over ran territory here which was occupied by the Khoi and the San. There was no title, we just occupied that land,” he said. “These people  were not even the original residents here. The people we call Baroa, the People of the South – Ba boroa, the People of the South, are originally  the Khoi, the first people  here.” He further reiterated that  black people should rid themselves of the view that all white people walking around own land – and those that do, bought it. The government can take the land back from them – but only if it shows a title deed saying “this is my land.” Some have alleged that Malema has biological roots in Ethiopia, but was unduly  using his privilege and influence as a lawmaker to intimidate and strip people of their legitimate assets. He further submitted that if this grab continues unabated, a serious legal suit will be instituted as South Africa was a nation governed by laid down laws and not arbitrary sentiments.
