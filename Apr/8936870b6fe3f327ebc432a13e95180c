Police officers shot and killed a man during an encounter at a Southeast Portland homeless shelter Sunday evening. Police said the man had crashed a stolen car nearby minutes earlier. Police found the man they believed to be the driver nearby around 8 p.m. During their encounter, Burley said, multiple officers fired at the man, who died. No officers or bystanders were injured. Burley said there were many witnesses, however, who were being interviewed late Saturday. As police responded to the crash, they received the man might be armed, Burley said, but he said it was still unclear if he was armed at the time of the shooting. It was also unclear if the man killed was involved in the earlier carjacking. Burley said the man had not been identified. Witnesses said the shooting occurred at a long-term and emergency homeless shelter operated by Cityteam Ministries. There was no evidence the man was with the shelter.
